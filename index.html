        <p> The first image presents a tranquil scene of a calm lake, which is surrounded by tall grass on one side and trees on the other. In the distance, snow-capped mountains can be seen. The sky is filled with a mix of blue and white clouds. This striking sky, along with the mountains, is perfectly reflected in the surface of the lake, contributing to a serene and picturesque atmosphere
